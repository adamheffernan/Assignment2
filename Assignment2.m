%%  
% In this section we model two simple cases. a 1D and 2D case using
% Laplaces finite difference method in Matrix form as to make it easier to
% add boxes into the simulation. The dimmensions given in the problem
% states a 3/2 Length v. Width, as such I used 30 and 20 as my mesh sizes
% for all problems solved in the scripts below. The Voltage at the boundary
% conditions is set to 1V for all cases modeled below.

% Figure 1 Above shows the 1D potential case where $X = V_0$ while $X = 0$ 
% and the potential as we approach all 3 other sides goes to 0. That is $X = 0$
% at $X = length$, $Y=0$ while $Y = 0$ and $Y = Width$. In this case the
% voltage is constant in the Y direction at 0V and rises linearly to 1V at
% between $X = 0$ and $X = length$

% Figure 2 and 3 Above shows the 1D potential case where $X = V_0$ while $X = 0$
